# This is the unWISE-SZ cross correlatiion project page.

We aim to do the cross correlation between unWISE blue galaxies and the tSZ map from CMB surveys.

The cross correlation between galcounts and Planck maps has shown significant dependence on the deprojection method, with variance across models diminishing as inreasing moments of CIB being deprojected.

Th ACT sample [https://portal.nersc.gov/project/act/dr6_nilc/ymaps_20230220/README] has a similar but more high definition CMB skymap than Planck, and similar nilc methods has been applied to get deprojection skymaps.
